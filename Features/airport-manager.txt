Ok, I'd like to create a feature to manage the airport list:

I'd like a menu item at the bottom next to the refresh called "Manage Airports..."
It should open a dialog box. That dialog box should have a Cancel and Save button and the Save button should be default.
Control: it should have a List of airports on the left. This list of airports should be a list by distance from wherever location services says I am. I'm not sure where we can get this list. For now we could use the list in the array.
On the right is the chosen airport list.
There should be arrows to add an airport from the left to the right.
The left box should be populated from the Airports API from aviationweather.gov (details below)
Then a button to remove an airport from the right list.
There should be text at the top that says "choose your airports"

The airport info should show Identifier, Name, Distance From the location of the mac, etc.
The API to get airport info is a GET call to https://aviationweather.gov/api/data/airport
And query string params:
ids=@WA,@OR,@ID
format=json
There's a lot of rich airport data here so I'd like to make sure we can create a good structure that we can use a lot of the information in the UI.
